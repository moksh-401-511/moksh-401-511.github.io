                I'm a Master of Science (by Research) student at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, specializing in Information Technology with a focus on Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Robotics. My research involves developing autonomous robotic systems capable of operating in complex, unstructured outdoor environments.

                Currently working as a Project Scientist at IIT Delhi's CAIR DRDO lab, I'm pushing the boundaries of robotic manipulation by integrating Vision Language Models with 3D computer vision techniques. My work enables robots to understand natural language instructions and execute multi-step manipulation tasks in real-world scenarios.

                With a strong foundation in Mechanical Engineering from NIT Meghalaya (CGPA: 8.68/10.0) and ongoing graduate studies at IIT Delhi (CGPA: 8.33/10.0), I combine theoretical knowledge with practical implementation to solve challenging problems in AI and robotics.
